Note: This fork has been modified for my own personal use-case to
only encode and decode XML strings in accordance with the XML-RPC spec.
All network-related features have been removed. You will need an external
HTTP client and/or server to use this.
The purpose of this fork is to update the encoding to UTF-8, to use
strings instead of atoms for methodName attributes, and to remove the
unused network-related code.
Additionally there is now only one single eunit test, and erlang.mk is
used to build in place of rebar.
All other documentation in the project has been left as-is and should
not be relied upon.

This is an HTTP 1.1 compliant XML-RPC library for Erlang. It is

published by http://www.xmlrpc.org/.

Prior to using this library you need a recent installation of Erlang.
Get it at http://www.erlang.org/.

Run make to compile, then start Erlang as "erl -pa ./ebin".
You are now ready to try the client and server examples in the
examples/ directory.
